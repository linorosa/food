# Food Guide

## What to Eat

This is an exhaustive list of the food I should focus on. Anything out of here isn't necessarily unhealthy, but it's at best not nutritionally worth it.

Besides the food choices, restrict eating to allow fasting for 14-16 hours a day.

### Meat

Look for grass-fed or at least organic. Eat no more than 4-6 ounces a day (roughly the size of a palm). Eat some organ meat.

### Eggs

Eat liberaly from pasture raised or organic hens. Omega-3 eggs are good and mean they're from chicken who were fed flaxseeds and other omega-3-rich foods.

### Milk and Dairy

Always grass-fed organic.

Eat:

- Butter and ghee are good in moderation.
- Yogurt with live cultures and Kefir.
- Cheese made with no additives.
- All the above made with goat's or sheep's milk.

### Fish and Seafood

Eat the small fish, always wild: 

- salmon
- mackerel
- anchovies
- sardines
- herring 

Canned is ok but watch out for BPA and get cans with olive oil - it preserves better the nutrients - and get with the bones.

### Vegetables

Best way to cook them is to steam for no more than 4 minutes: they should still be bright and crunchy. Don't microwave them. Some vitamins are fat-soluble, so eat veggies with fat.

Frozen is as good (and sometimes better) as fresh.

Eat:

- Broccoli, Kale (organic), Cabbage, Brussels Sprouts
- Broccoli Sprouts
- Dark leafy greens (all organic) like Arugula, Spinach, Swiss Chard and Collard Greens
- Alliums such as Garlic, Shallots and Onions
- High-fiber veggies like Celery (organic) and Asparagus
- Shiitake, Oyster and Cremini Mushrooms
- Radishes, Turnip Greens and Beet Greens
- Cucumbers (organic), Escarole and Watercress
- Zucchiniand Okra
- Sweet Potatoes and Winter Squash (1 cup a few times a week)
- Kabocha or Pumpkin Squash
- Seaweed (wakame, kombu, nori)
- Red, yellow or purple Carrots
- Jerusalem Artichokes (Sunchockes)
- Kohlrabi
- Fermented veggies (kimchi, kombucha, tempeh, miso, sauerkraut), but never prepared with vinegar because it kills the live bacteria.
- Tomatoes (organic)
- Peppers (organic)

### Fruit

Always eat organic. Frozen is also good and sometimes even better.

Eat:

- Wild blueberries, cherries, blackberries and raspberries
- Stone fruit like plums, peaches, nectarines, cherries and others
- Oranges, grapefruits, tangerines and other citrus fruits
- Pomegranates, kiwis and papayas
- Weird fruit like goji berries, acai berries, gooseberries or dragon fruit
- Fat fruits like avocados, coconut and olives
- Lemons and limes

### Fats and oils

Eat:

- 2-3 tbsp of a 1:1 mix of coconut oil and MCT oil 3 times/day
- Olive oil from California
- Coconut oil
- Avocado oil
- Organic animal fat: tallow, lard, duck fat

### Beans

1/2 cup to 1 cup a day max. Ideally not every day.

Soak them overnight, cook with kombu to make them more digestible. Avoid cans, otherwise use organic, BPA-free cans.

Eat:

- Non-GMO, organic traditional soybean-based foods: tofu, tempeh, natto, miso, and organic gluten-free soy sauce or tamari
- Peas and lentis (especially red ones, which don't require soaking)
- Black beans, garbanzo beans and adzuki beans
- Organic green beans and snow peas
- Black-eyed peas, asparagus beans and other members of the cowpea family
- Edamame, but don't overdo
- Mung beans

### Grains

Eat once a day, tops. A 1/2 cup serving max.

Eat:

- Whole grain bread: spelt or dark German rye
- Weird grain: amaranth, millet, teff
- Rice: black rice, brown rice, red rice, wild rice (actually a seed)
- Quinoa, actually not really a grain and supre nutritious

### Nuts and Seeds

Eat them raw and organic, a couple of handfuls a day.

Eat:

- almonds
- walnuts
- pecans
- hazelnuts
- brazil nuts
- pistachios
- macademia nuts
- cashews
- Seeds: pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, ground flaxseeds, hemp seeds, sesame seeds

### Sugars and sweeteners

Eat:

- Liquids: molasses, organic maple syrup, honey
- Granulated: organic palm sugar, coconut sugar
- Date sugar
- Erythritol, sparingly - new data suggests it causes weight gain

## Supplementation

- Multivitamin             = as directed
- Fish oil (EPA/DHA)       = 1 - 2 grams
- Vitamin D3               = 1,000 IU to 2,000 IU
- Magnesium glycinate      = 100 mg to 200 mg
- Chromium                 = 200 mcg to 500 mcg
- Folate or methyl folate  = 400 mcg to 800 mcg
- MCT Oil                  = 3 tbsp/day

Here's what I'm going with for now:

- Multivitamine = Pure Encapsulations UltraNutrient (try Thorne Multi-Encap)
- Fish oil      = PaleoEthics AquaOmega Softgels
- Vitamin D3    = Pure Encapsulations Vitamin D3
- MCT Oil       = St. Francis Herb Farm Ghee & MCT Oil (try NOW sports)

### Multivitamin

Thorne seems to be the best brand: they have their own factories and do their
own testing. The capsules are also spaced through the day, which theoretically
helps absorption.

PureGenomics is also good but they rely on other factories and written statements 
from them that they don't use A or B.

Naturelo looks just as good as PureGenomics.

Some options:

- Thorne Multi-Encap
- PureGenomics® UltraNutrient
- PureGenomics® Men's Nutrients
- Naturelo One Daily for Men
