# Asparagus Beef Stir-Fry

_From nom nom paleo's Ready or Not book (p. 280)_

1. In a small bowl, whisk together:
	
	- 1/2 cup **[all-purpose stir-fry sauce](/sauces/all-purpose-stir-fry-sauce.md)**
    - 1 tsp **tapioca powder**

2. In another bowl combine and marinate for 10 minutes:

    - 1.5 lb **flank steak**, thinly sliced against the grain
    - 1 tbsp **avocado oil**
    - 1 tsp **fish sauce**
    - 1/2 tsp **sesame oil**
    - 1/2 tsp **salt**

3. Add oil to a pan over medium-high. Once shimmering hot, add the steak. Cook for 1-2 minutes until mostly cooked. It's ok if it's still a little pink.

4. Transfer beef to another platter. Leave the liquid.

5. Add and cook until shallots are transluscent and mushrooms are softened (2-3 minutes):

    - 1 large **shallot**, thinly sliced
    - 2 **scallions**, root trimmed, cut into 2-inch segments
    - 1/4 lb fresh **shiitake mushrooms**, stemmed and sliced

6. Add and cook for 30 seconds:

    - 2 **garlic cloves**, minced

7. Toss in and cook until tender crisp:

    - 1 lb **thin asparagus**, tough ends trimmed, cut into 2 inch segments
    - 1 large **carrot**, peeled and thinly sliced on the diagonal

8. Add the beef and sauce. Cook until sauce thickens and beef cooks through.
