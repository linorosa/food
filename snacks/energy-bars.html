<h1>Energy Bars</h1>
<hr/>

<b>This recipe is a work in progress...</b>
<i>
    I want to try some other things with it, such as making them no-bake by using nut butters, and/or a mix of water and psyllum husk powder.
    Check out <a href="https://eighty20nutrition.com/crunchy-energy-bars/">this other recipe</a> which uses 3 tsp of psyllum husk and 1/2 cup of water instead of egg whites. But I'll probably have to double the amount and also add a bit of oil.

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<h6>Egg mix:</h6>
<div>
    <span>120g <em>egg whites</em></span>
    <span>70g <em>bocha sweet</em></span>
    <span>1 tsp <em>salt</em></span>
    <span>1/2 tsp <em>cinnamon</em></span>
</div>

<h6>Dry ingredients:</h6>
<div>
    <span>100g <em>pepitas</em></span>
    <span>100g <em>flax seeds</em></span>
    <span>100g <em>sunflower seeds</em></span>
    <span>50g <em>macadamia nuts</em></span>
    <span>50g <em>chia seeds</em></span>
    <span>50g <em>peanut butter</em></span>
</div>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        Whisk <span>egg whites</span> on a large bowl until frothy.
        Add <span>bocha sweet</span>, <span>salt</span> and <span>cinnamon</span>. Whisk until completely foamy.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add in all <span>dry ingredients</span> and mix to combine well.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ideally use a silicon mold shaped like granola bars.
        I don't have one so I'll spread the mix on a baking sheet, keeping a square-ish shape that I'll cut into bars once cooked.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cook for <b>45 minutes</b> at <b>250F</b>.
        Then rotate the trays and cook for another <b>45 minutes</b>.
        Allow them to cool for at least 30 minutes.
    </li>
</ol>
