_From [all recipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgzGkfAK-A0)_

1. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in leeks and onions and cook until the onion softens and turns translucent, about 5 minutes.

	- 2 tbsp **butter**
	- 2 **leeks** chopped	(white and light green parts)
	- 2 **onions** chopped

2. Add in:

	- 2 large **russet potatoes** sliced
	- 1 **butternut squash** cubbed
	- 5 **carrots** diced
	- 2 **granny smith apples** sliced
	- 2 quart **chicken stock**

3. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the vegetables are soft, about 20 minutes.

4. Carefully puree the soup in batches in a blender, or use a stick blender to puree the soup right in the pot. Once the soup has been pureed, return it to the pot and stir in wine and cream. 

	- 1/4 cup **dry white wine**
	- 1 cup **cream**
	- 1/2 tsp **nutmeg**

5. Season and simmer gently for 5 minutes.
