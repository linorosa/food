# Oven Roasted Veggies

1. Cut vegetables

	- **Zucchinis**
	- **Carrots**
	- **Onions**
	- **Brussels sprouts**
	- **Butternut squash**
	- **Sweet potatoes**
	- **Rutabaga**

2. Coat them in olive oil, salt and pepper.

3. Roast at 450F for 35 to 40 min.

Store uncooked and cook during the week before eating. Itâ€™s much better out of the oven.
