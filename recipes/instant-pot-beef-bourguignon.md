1) Generously season beef chunks with salt and pepper, and set aside.

```

2) On a large skillet, add diced bacon and cook until crispy. Then remove into Instant Pot.

```
5 strips bacon, diced
```

3) Brown the beef in batches on the same pan, removing into the Intant Pot.

4) Cook onions, then garlic.

```
1 onion, chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
```

5) Add and cook for a bit, scraping the bits from the bottom. Then remove to Instant Pot.

```
3/4 cup  dry red wine
1   tbsp tomato paste
```

6) Add to the Instant Pot and mix.

```
10 ounces cremini mushrooms, quartered
2         carrots, chopped
1 tsp     dried thyme
3         bay leaves (on top)
```

7) Cook at high pressure for 40 minutes, followed by a manual pressure release.

8) Uncover and remove bay leaves. Select the sautee mode. Evenly sprinle xanthan gum over the pot and stir together. Let the stew boil for a minute to thicken while stirring, then turn off.
