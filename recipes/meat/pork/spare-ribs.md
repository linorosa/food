1. Prepare the rub

```
4 tbsp salt
1 tbsp black pepper
1 tsp white pepper
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp garlic powder
```

2. On a separate bowl, mix

```
2 tsp Dijon mustard
2 tbsp white vinegar
```

3. Place ribs on a foil-lined baking sheet. Turn rubs over so meat side is down. Make some small slashes every few inches on the membranes that cover the ribs.

```
1 slab pork ribs
```

4. Brush about 1/2 of the Dijon mustard and sprinkle about 40% of the rub. Turn over and brush the rest of the Dijon mixture and the rub.

5. Refrigerate 4 to 12 hours before cooking.

6. Bake at 300F for 1:30 hours. Remove and baste with the pan drippings. Cook for another 1:30 hours until very tender.

7. Remove and baste again. Let rest for 15 minutes before cutting and serving.
