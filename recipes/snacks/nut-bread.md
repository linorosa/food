1. Combine all dry ingredients

```
1 cup (135g) sunflower seeds
1/2 cup (90g) flax seeds
1/2 cup (65g) hazelnuts or almonds
1.5 cups (145g) rolled oats
2 tbsp chia seeds
4 tbsp psyllium seed husks (or 3 tbsp if using powder)
1 tsp fine salt (or 1/2 tsp coarse salt)
(optional) dried fruit
```

2. Whisk separately

```
1 tbsp maple syrup
3 tbsp oil
1.5 cups (350ml) water
```

3. Mix everything and put on a parchement-lined loaf pan. Let it sit on the counter for at least 2 hours. Ideally overnight.

4. Bake at 350F for 20 minutes.

5. Remove from pan. Place directly on the oven rack upside down and bake another 30-40 minutes.

It's ready when it's hollow when tapped. Let it cool completely before slicing.
