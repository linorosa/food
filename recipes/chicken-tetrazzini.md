## Chicken

First, bake and cube the chicken. Place it on a baking sheet, brush with oil, salt and pepper.

* 2.5 lb boneless chicken breasts
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 1/2 tbsp oil

Bake for 40 minutes at 375F until chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165F.

Let the chicken cool and cube into 1/2-inch pieces.

## Squash

Cut a spaguetti squash in two and scoop out the seeds. Then lay them cut side up on a baking sheet.

Bake for 45 to 60 minutes at 400F until it easily pulls away with a fork.

Once cool enough to handle, remove strands.

## Mushroom

Dice the onion and mince the garlic

* 1 small white onion
* 4 cloves garlic

Wash and slice the mushrooms

* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms

Cook the above on a skillet for 5 to 7 minutes.

## The rest

Melt butter on a saucepan. Add the flour and whisk until smooth.

* 2 tbsp butter
* 2 tbsp tapioca flour

Slowly pour in the broth, whisking constantly to smooth out any lumps, then whisk in the heavy cream, salt and pepper.

* 1 1/2 cup chicken broth
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper

Bring to a boil, then stir in and simmer for 2 minutes:

* cubed cooked chicken
* cooked mushroom mixture
* 1 cup frozen peas

Layer the cooked spaguetti squash on the bottom of a baking dish. Then add the chicken mixture above.

Bake for 30 minutes at 350F.
