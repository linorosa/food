Preheat the oven to 375F.

Sprinkle all sides of tenderloin with the rub.

Heat a stainless steel skillet over high heat.

Add some oil, and sear all sides of tenderloin. About 2 minutes per side.

Transfer to the oven and bake for 25 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the pork reads 160F.

Let the pork rest for 10 minutes before cutting.
